**This project is no longer active.**

I've been away from Tieba for a while and have no plans to go back.

Maintaining such a scraper project requires a sustained commitment to catch up with upstream changes.

~~It may be still working as you read this line of text, but it will likely to be broken in the distant future.~~ For `subito`, it never came to life :(

As of this writing (August 2023), I recommend using https://github.com/Starry-OvO/aiotieba . This is probably the most powerful toolkit for Tieba and the guys behind this project rocks. Make sure to check it out.

However, you still are welcome to fork under the terms of the MIT license.

**该项目已停止维护。**

我离开贴吧很长时间了，而且不打算再回去。

这样的爬虫/刮削项目需要持续的维护来跟进上游的变化。

~~当你读到这行字时，它可能依旧能用，但终有一天会失效。~~ `subito` 从未成真，甚是遗憾。

截至目前（2023 年 8 月），我个人推荐使用 https://github.com/Starry-OvO/aiotieba 。这大概是目前最强大的贴吧工具，背后的人真的很牛逼，千万不可错过。

不过，我仍然欢迎你根据 MIT license 进行 fork。
